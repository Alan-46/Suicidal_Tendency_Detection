# Suicidal Tendency Detection

Mental health is an often neglected area in our lives, tragically many people end up suffering and taking their own lives just because they didnâ€™t receive proper help at the right moment. This project proposes a solution that can hopefully provide help to those who are in dire need of it. We use Machine learning (NLP in particular) to identify if a particular individual is showing signs of a mental health crisis. If it identifies such a person with a high confidence, then the system alerts a mental health professional who can then quickly provide the much-needed help and guidance. This project is intended to make sure no other life is thrown away and to alleviate suffering.
